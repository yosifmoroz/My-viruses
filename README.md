This has 3 exes. Game justgoes into ur startup folder and spams u with windows errors 
Pacman and Test log ur PC data and send it to a webhook. i think both of hem also open an app which is unclosable. I remember trying to add a function for them to go in ur startup folder, but it doesnt work. Everything was made in Python.
